In my case, I regretted not having studied some natural science in high school after I realised 
that I would have to study statistics and mathematics ar university.
-Therefore, it is often later in life that the importance of a good education is realised.

  During peak travel times, or rush hours, the roads are very busy.
  There are often traffic jams, and it can take thirty minutes to travel five or six kilometres by car.
  However, travel by public transport, such as train, bus, or ferry, is much better.
  It is reliable, fast, and comfortable, but not always as convenient as travelling by private car.
