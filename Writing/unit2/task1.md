#UNIT AIMS

In this unit, you will learn:

* how to identify different types of visuals
* how to describe the topic of visuals
* how to describe the main features shown in visuals
* how to write overview paragraphs describing visuals (summarise the key information)

###Introduction to Writing Task 1: Visuals

Types of Visuals
* bar chart
* pie chart
* line graph
* table
* diagram
* flow chart
* map

Data about many topics are often given in a visual format, for example weather patterns, sales reports, or population statistics. 

__Remember that you will need to write 150 words for Task 1__

When analyzing the data, the frist thing you need to do is look at the tittle of the visual.

If you are given a __Bar chart__, identify the two axis and what they represent, then look if the graph has several bar sets (generally represented by colors)...

If the graph is a __Pie chart__, realize that the whole pie represents 100% of something, so identify the large pieces and then the smaller pieces of the chart.

The __Line chart__ is used to show changes over time. Like the bar chart, this visual also has two axes. First, we should read what each of the lines represent. Analyze the behaviour, but keep it to the facts, you might be tempted at this point to speculate as to the reasons why this change has occurred, but do not do this. In Task 1 of the IELTS Academic Writing Test you are simply required to describe the data that is presented in the visual. The task does not require you to give your opinions or to speculate about the data.

Next, we’ll look at a __Table__. With this type of data, you would need to use the past tense when you discuss the information, as these dates are in the past. Sometimes you are given a date in the future, like 2050 for example, and you would need to use future verb forms to discuss those figures.

Remember, we should not make any comment about the reasons why this change has occurred because no data about that is given in the table.

In the next type of visual, __Diagrams__, you will see a combination of words and pictures. 
It is usual for diagrams to progress from left to right, or from top to bottom.
This diagram shows how something is produced at any time, so you should use the present tense to show general time.

The next type of visual we’ll look at is actually quite similar to the diagram. It’s the __Flow chart__. With this, we see the process of how something works or is produced, so we can expect to see arrows as well as words and pictures.
Again, we’ll start from the left of the flow chart and follow the arrows to the right of the page. 
This flow chart describes a process that happens in general time, so you would use the present tense to write about it.

You are probably very familiar with the last type of visual that you might be given in
Task 1 of the Writing Test. It’s a __Map__. With this type of visual you need to describe
the location of places in relation to other places. This means you’ll use __**prepositions**__.
It’s worth pointing out that you may be given two maps to describe in this task. For
example, you might have to compare two maps of the same area, one from 1980 and one from
2010, and describe the changes that have occurred over that time.

As it was mentioned earlier, when we where talking about maps, sometimes you will be 
given two related visuals to describe. You’ll need to choose the important features of both visuals and
say how they are related.
To write the response, first you would describe one graph, and then the other. At the end, you
would write one or two sentences to show how they are related. We’ll look at this more
closely later in the unit.
