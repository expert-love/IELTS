##WRITING TASK 1 - My Answer

The graph shows the number of employees in an european country, clasificaded by age and gender, in witch shows that in almost any age the companies employ more male than female workers. In the graph, is shown algo that the highest trend of age for male to be employeed happens a little earlier that female, even with fact that both gender reach theirs peak at exactly the same age, witch is between 40 and 44 years old. A peculiar behaviour is present on the very first age in the chart, the age between 15 and 19, where the women are more employeed than men, and that is because the very nature of the female gender, more mature and responsable at a early stage in the life. Another relevant fact, is the gender gap (that is the difference between the employees of both genders), in the chart you can see that male reach the band of five houndred thousend employees in 5 age, but female never reach that band, that shows a bad pratice in the working industry about gender equiality.

##WRITING TASK 1 - Sample Answer


The chart gives information about employment in terms of age and sex in a European country in 2013.

The most striking feature is that employed men outnumber employed women in all age groups apart from the 15-19 year age group, where women (approximately 280 000) slightly outnumber men (approximately 270 000).

Turning to differences in employment in terms of age group, it can be seen that the group with the highest participation in the workforce is aged between 35 and 44, with close to 1 200 000 male workers and almost 1 000 000 female workers. The age groups above and below this one, 25-34 and 45-54, are ranked second, with between 1 000 000 and 1 100 000 men and 830 000 to 850 000 women.

For female workers, next comes the 20-24 age group, followed by the group aged 55-64, and then the 15-19 year old group. For male workers, the group aged 55-64 is next, followed by the 20-24 age group and finally, the 15-19 year old group. The group with the lowest participation in the workforce is aged 65+, with around 100 000 men employed and half that number of female workers.

What solutions can you suggest?

##WRITING TASK 2 - My Answer

In my opinion, the gap between the rich and the poor is widening because of several reasons, but the most important is the education that the poor is recieving is even worst than before, and is almost designed to prevent that the poor can break the poverty cicle.

This is a old discussion, and there no lack of opinion about it, but the truth is that in recient times the society have improve very little on the way that provides tools and mechanisims to the poor, not in order to give short time solutions, but to take them out of their present situation and stay out of the poverty line.

In the center of this discussion, of course, is the political systems. Many claims that capitalism and free market are the responsable for the on growing number of poors, but the evidence shows different. The countries that are more effective on remove people from the poverty conditions, are those with more economic inclusive politics, witch are closely related with the free market and the state of law in the contry.

The detractors of the capitalism, who claims that socialsm of even comunism are the solution, forget corruption and inefficience create more poor than any politial system. That is way, comunism and socialism, are more likely to create more poor, just for the simple fact thar are systems with more presence of corruption.

So, it is my opinion that the growing gap between poor and rich, is because bad education, that leads to more ignorant people, who are more tollerant with corruption, and that of course, is very attractive to the rich and powerfull.

##WRITING TASK 2 - Sample Answer


Economic prosperity has been a feature of many countries over the last half century. This has, on the whole, raised the standard of living and reduced the numbers of people who would be considered destitute, and may have led to a redefinition of poverty. However, within those countries, the difference between the poorest and wealthiest citizens has increased. This essay will outline some of the possible causes and some suggested solutions to this situation.

The main cause of the widening gap in personal wealth is the overriding need for companies to make ever-increasing profits. Although this has fuelled many positive developments in society, such as higher employment rates and greater national revenue, many employees are rewarded to excess for their ability to make more money for their employers. We commonly see CEOs being paid, or even paying themselves, exorbitant salaries, sometimes in the millions. This characteristic of many listed companies has a trickle-down effect to subordinate employees. Consequently, many people have too much personal wealth.

One solution to this would be the gradual introduction of socially responsible ethics in business where the profit motive is moderated by greater attention to philanthropy and financial support to those in need. This could be encouraged by tax incentives from government for such community support programs. Another measure could be the instigation of salary caps. There is surely no need for anyone to be paid an annual salary in the millions.

Overall, society is more materialistic than ever and this need to acquire has driven the accumulation of wealth. Changing tax and employment regulations may help redistribute some of the excess wealth to those who are struggling financially.
